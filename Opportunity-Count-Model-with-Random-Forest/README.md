<p>
All three models use Random Forest. The difference is the features that are used in each model. 
</p>
<p>
run "mainOCM.m" to get predictablity of the proposed model. The whole dataset is stratified by the opportunity count.
</p>
<p>
run "mainSimple.m" to get predictablity of traditional model without opportunity count as features.
</p>
<p>
run "mainSimpleWithOpp.m" to get predictablity of traditional model with opportunity count as features.
</p>
<p>
run "KTmain15.m" to get predictablity of knowledge tracing model.
